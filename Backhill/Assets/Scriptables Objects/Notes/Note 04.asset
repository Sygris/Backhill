  Description: "I saw them take him in there, into the surgery room. They took him
    in and he hasn\u2019t come out again. I can hear it\u2026 God, the sound of it.
    I\u2019m hiding, in the toilets. They\u2019ll find me, I\u2019m sure of it, but
    I have to try or else they\u2019ll take me too. They took him!"
